== How do I use it? ==

### Setting up a course

To **create a course**, click on ‘course’ on the admin bar, add new, and then enter the course title and description in the spaces provided. You can use the page builder to construct the layout.

After doing this, you will need to fill in the course’s settings fields at the bottom of the page. Details required here include the **course level**, **number of students**, **course duration**, **skill level**, and the **date range** of the course.

Clicking on the next tab over will bring up the accessibility options. This is where you input the **course price** (leaving the field blank if you are making the course available for free). You can additionally exclude the course from any membership plans here.

The ‘Announcement’ section allows you to publish any additional information that your students will need to have before starting the course.

In the final tab, you can add any frequently asked questions. This allows you to save time by anticipating any questions that customers may have about the course and answering them before they have even been asked.

### Developing lessons

The curriculum is developed by creating new sections and lessons following the guidance provided. A further benefit here is that you can add in previously created content such as **lessons and quizzes**.

In the building section, found at the bottom of the course development page, you need to enter details on the new section and then on the first lesson in the relevant places. Upon entering a lesson title and clicking on the pencil icon, you are redirected to the page builder, which you are advised to use for editing lesson content. Here you can create three different types of lessons: **text lessons**, **video lessons**, and **slideshow lessons**. It is easy to add in elements, templates, or text blocks.

Upon finishing the lesson, you will need to select the lesson type from the dropdown menu situated in the lower part of the screen, write a description and enable the **preview** to allow people who haven’t yet purchased the course to view the details.

### Constructing quizzes

To input a quiz, you need to go back to the building section at the bottom of the course development page and enter a title in the quiz field. After clicking on the pencil icon, you will be redirected to the relevant page for this.

From there, you can then type in the first question and click on the plus symbol on the top left side of the screen to select the question type. There are three options to choose from here – single choice, multiple-choice and true or false. Here you will be prompted to enter the answers.

You repeat this process each time and can add as many questions as you like. You can also opt to add countdown timers to quizzes. Finally, you need to add the metadata – this includes a description of the quiz and details on its duration. You can also set up a passing score for the quiz or set the questions to shows the correct answer.
